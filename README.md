## Week 1

Chosen assignment: Zen Garden Personal goal: create shapes and try to animate
them

Before starting with the assignment I went on Pinterest to find some inspiration
for a design. I knew I already wanted to do something with Japanese food and
eventually I chose a few ramen menus/posters to base my design off and try to
recreate certain things I saw in CSS.

The next day I started experimenting with `clip-path` to create different
shapes. Using clip-path I managed to create a ramen bowl with chopsticks on top.
I also animated the ramen bowl by using `keyframes`.

I experimented with the following CSS techniques for the first time:

-  Keyframes/animations
-  Creating shapes with clip-path
-  Using pseudo-elements

## Week 2

At the start of week 2 I conceptualized a bit and I had the idea to create a
cover for the menu. On the cover I will mainly be experimenting with CSS and try
to do all sorts of crazy stuff. With this in mind I looked at things I could try
to recreate in CSS and I managed to create Mt. Fuji with a cloud hovering
besides it as well!

For the menu I wanted to implement the imperial Japanese flag in the design and
I recreated it using `radial-gradient` and `repeating-conic-gradient`

I decided to remove the chopsticks from the ramen bowl and use that circle as a
rising sun instead. Using `animations` I made the sun rise from behind the
mountain to recreate the effect of a rising sun.

During this week I experimented with the following CSS techniques:

-  Filter()
-  Radial-gradient
-  Repeating-conic-gradient
-  Using a japanese font
-  Transform()

## Week 3

In the last week finished the cover and the last thing I had to do was create
the menu for the actual dishes. Creating the menu was particularly tedious in my
opinion because my elements were nested and I had to get my head around using
the correct CSS selectors to select a element in CSS.

A personal goal of mine was to try to create some kind of pattern using CSS as
well. By making a wavy line using `pseudo-elements` I managed to create a wavy
line that resembles a noodle strand.

The final version looks as follows:
